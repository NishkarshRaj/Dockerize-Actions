## Dockerize-Actions

ActionsHackathon submission for Dev: GitHub Actions Hackathon - Dockerize your source code repository on GitHub, build it remotely via GitHub Actions and deploy it on GitHub Packages.

## About

Open source projects contain source code which must be built into end-applications.

These must be deployed on servers and made available to the end-users.

To make this process easy, this GitHub Actions can be used.

It builds the source code fetched from open source repositories remotely in **Docker containers** using **Build tools** (Maven is used here) and deploys the **cross-platform Docker Image** on GitHub Packages publically.
